## Testing

I have tested that all the links work to the various pages regardless what page you are on.

I have comfirmed that the website works and behaves the same in different browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge)

I have tested that the site looks good and behaves the same on all different screen sizes using devtools and opened the website on difrent devices.

I comfirmed that the book venue section only accepts the relevent input in the field and that it sends the data by including the (action="https://formdump.codeinstitute.net/") in the form

## Bugs 

Had one bug in the second section in index.html where I could not change the color of element h2 when I used color white or #fff but if I used rgb it worked.
